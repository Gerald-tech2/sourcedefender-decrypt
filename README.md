## What is SourceDefender?
[SourceDefender](https://sourcedefender.co.uk) is a tool used to protect python files. Make them unreadable to human eye. You can read more about this [here](https://sourcedefender.co.uk)

## üìù About our project

Many .pye files increasingly contain hidden malicious code or viruses, which is why we have published a full decryption of SourceDefender-protected files. This service provides a simple and safe way to restore .pye files back to the exact .py source code as it existed before obfuscation.

> **Important:** This service must **not** be used to access, redistribute, or modify code belonging to others without permission. By using the site you confirm you have the right to decrypt the uploaded file.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. Go to: [https://sourcedefender.onrender.com](https://sourcedefender.onrender.com)
2. Upload your `.pye` file.
3. Wait for the decryption to complete ‚Äî results are presented in the browser.
4. Source code recovered will be shown below.

## üîì What you get by using our website

* **Exact decryption** of the uploaded `.pye` back to its original `.py` source code.
* **Safe and simple process** without any modifications or special analysis.

---

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ How it works (high-level)

Uploaded `.pye` bundles are processed in the browser using `sdw.min.js`, which contains obfuscated code and an embedded Rust WebAssembly module. The WebAssembly simply decrypts the `.pye` file, producing the **original `.py` source code**. No extra analysis or modifications are performed ‚Äî this is just a direct decryption.

## üîß Deeper explaination (for educatinal purposes)

We written a very deep explaination and python-based SourceDefender Decryption Tool written in Python here:

## ü•∑ Privacy & Security

* Uploaded files are stored temporarily for processing and deleted after decryption.
* Files and results are deleted after processing (configurable retention window shown at upload).
* We encrypt files in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
